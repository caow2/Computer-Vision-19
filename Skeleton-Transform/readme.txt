Skeleton Transformation of a simple deer image.

The morphological skeleton of the image is extracted by finding its skeleton sets.

An approximation of the original image is reconstructed using morphological operations on the skeleton sets.
A few lower order subsets were left out in the reconstruction of the image (reconstruction-lowest-1.png left out the lowest order set), and we can see that the approximation becomes less accurate.
